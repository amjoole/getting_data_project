the purpose of this repository is to clean the data provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository.
You should set the working direction to "UCI HAR Dataset" folder and source all 3 .R functions. Then just run cleanmydata(). It will produce 3 useful data sets in global environment. First one which is named "meanofdata", which is also returned and printed by the function, is our desired clean data, in which we can observe the mean value of 79 variables for 6 different activities. Those variables are all of standard or mean variables, just as it was wanted in the project.
Another useful data set is named "cleaned data", which includes all desired variable values (not the mean value, but all values).
The last one is "dataset_merged", which is simply our data merged with it's original names. (in the subject column, instead of numbers, there are activity names)
